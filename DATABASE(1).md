|----------|----------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Level    | INTEGER  | Level number (part of primary key)              |
| Timeslot | INTEGER  | Timeslot identifier within the level (part of primary key) |
| PV       | INTEGER  | Value related to photovoltaic electricity game event rectangles |
| Wind     | INTEGER  | Value related to wind energy electricity game event rectangles |
| Fossil   | INTEGER  | Value related to fossil fuel electricity game event rectangles |

The values for PV, Wind, Fossil indicate how long the respective game event rectangles are that are being displayed at the specified timeslots. 


## üìã Table: Level_Infos

| Column                               | Type    | Description                                               |

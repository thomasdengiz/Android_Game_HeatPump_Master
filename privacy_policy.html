    <p>This app does not collect any personal data or use third-party analytics or tracking services.</p>
    <p>The only data collected is when you voluntarily submit a high score for leaderboard purposes after completing a level. In that case, the following information is stored:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Your entered name</li>
      <li>Your score</li>
      <li>The date of submission</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If your score does not make it into the overall top 10 for the completed level, it will be automatically deleted after one month.</p>
    <p>If you wish to have your submitted data removed, please email <a href="mailto:thomas.dengiz@yahoo.de">thomas.dengiz@yahoo.de</a>.</p>
